## Key Features <!-- omit in toc -->

**🎨 Theme anything**: Anything that extends tailwind's config and can be expressed in css variables is something you can theme with this plugin

**🍨 Unlimited themes**: You can have as many themes as you want! This plugin doesn't care!

**😅 Easy theme management**: A simple, declarative api that lets you easily create and modify themes

**👋 Familiar api**: The way you declare themes is the exact same way you [extend tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#extending-the-default-theme) with the exact same features

**💻 Modern**: Powered by css variables under the hood

**🚀 Designed to reduce bundle size**: Instead of duplicating all of your style definitions, the use of css variables lets you declare styles once
